						Until recently, I thought I did not much care if Scotland voted for independence. But, now, as the prospect becomes very real, I am surprised by how upset I feel. I follow the polls obsessively. I fume at the incompetence of the No campaign and the insularity of the Yes. And my sense of foreboding grows as the day grows closer.

						After 307 years as part of Great Britain, Scotland will soon decide whether it is time to once again go it alone. Opinion polls suggest that nationalists still fall short of the numbers needed to unpick the 1707 parliamentary union with England that lies at the heart of the UK. But nationalist and pro-union campaigners alike agree that with eight months of febrile campaigning to go, the result of September’s historic referendum is far from assured.

			<div class='comment__text'>Lagarde and I are here because she recently celebrated an anniversary: just over three years ago she took over as managing director of the International Monetary Fund, the first woman to run the mighty $760bn organisation that is charged with promoting global financial and monetary stability. She arrived, however, amid great instability. The IMF’s former managing director, Dominique Strauss-Kahn, had just resigned after becoming entangled in a sordid sex scandal in a New York hotel. “It was a very bizarre time,” Lagarde drolly observes, stressing her words. The world outside the IMF was also experiencing its own, financial, crisis.
